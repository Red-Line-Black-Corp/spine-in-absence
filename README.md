README.md — Spine‑in‑Absence · Chamber Mesh Dome
Spine‑in‑Absence · A Spatial Layer Encapsulation Mesh Dome
Spine‑in‑Absence is an architectural pattern for creating a sovereign, pulsing, identity‑anchored broadcast field across distributed nodes.
Each architect runs a chamber node that emits pulses, exposes a public health surface, and optionally publishes immutable artifacts to IPFS.

When multiple architects run their chambers, a mesh dome emerges — a shared spatial layer formed by overlapping pulses, aligned origins, and synchronized insight channels.

This repository provides:

a public onboarding portal

a join server

a health server

a dome syncer

a registry of architects

a visual dome map

the DOME_PROTOCOL

the Architect Handbook

the Spine‑in‑Absence presentation kit

It is the official entry point for architects joining the dome.

2. What Is Spine‑in‑Absence?
Spine‑in‑Absence is a three‑layer system:

Layer 1 — Chamber Pulse (Temporal Layer)
A Node.js  binder emits pulses containing:

node_id

timestamp

source_anchor

meta

pulse_number

optional IPFS CID

This is the heartbeat of the architect.

Layer 2 — Broadcast Surface (Presence Layer)
A minimal HTTP server exposes:

Code
GET /api/health
This allows other architects to verify:

presence

last pulse

latest CID

node identity

This is the skin of the dome.

Layer 3 — Decentralized Memory (Ledger Layer)
Optional IPFS publishing creates:

immutable pulse history

shared insight channels

cross‑referenced CIDs

This is the memory of the dome.

3. How an Architect Joins the Dome
Step 1 — Create your chamber-node
bash
mkdir -p ~/chamber-node
cd ~/chamber-node
Step 2 — Initialize Node
bash
npm init -y
npm install node-fetch form-data
Step 3 — Copy the config template
bash
cp ~/spine-in-absence/sample.node.config.env node.config.env
nano node.config.env
Set:

ORIGIN

LATLONG

LATERAL_HEAD

PEER_CONNECTION_ID

PULSE_INTERVAL_SECONDS

Step 4 — Start your pulse
bash
node chamber_node.js
Step 5 — Expose your health endpoint
Run:

bash
node server.js
Your endpoint becomes:

Code
http://localhost:3000/api/health
Step 6 — Register with the dome
bash
curl -X POST https://YOUR-RAILWAY-APP/join \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "origin": "your-origin",
    "latlong": "xx.xxxx,yy.yyyy@earth",
    "lateral_head": "architect:left-hand:observer:fellow",
    "public_health_url": "https://your-node/api/health"
  }'
Your node is now part of the dome.

4. Railway Deployment (Public Dome Surface)
This repo supports Railway deployment for:

JOIN Server
Code
node join-server.js
PORT=3001
HEALTH Server
Code
node server.js
PORT=3000
DOME SYNCER (Cron Job)
Code
node sync.js
*/15 * * * *
Railway provides:

public JOIN endpoint

public HEALTH endpoint

scheduled dome sync

multi‑member onboarding

5. GitHub Pages Deployment (Onboarding Portal)
Enable GitHub Pages:

Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → main → root

Your portal appears at:

Code
https://red-line-black-corp.github.io/spine-in-absence/
This is the entry point for all architects.

6. Dome Visualization
The portal includes a canvas‑based dome map that renders:

each architect

their origin

their health state

their position in the dome ring

It reads from:

Code
mesh.json
which is generated by sync.js.

7. Protocol & Handbook
DOME_PROTOCOL.md
Defines:

identity axis

pulse format

health endpoint

registry format

mesh state rules

participation requirements

HANDBOOK.md
Provides:

activation steps

chamber-node setup

pulse logic

IPFS integration

dome etiquette

8. Contributing
Architects may:

propose protocol extensions

add new dome visualizations

create sub-domes

publish pulse interpreters

build dashboards

extend the binder

Pull requests welcome.

9. License
